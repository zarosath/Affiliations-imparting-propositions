to this day, i have never gained any economic financial or social realization or gain, its not a part of my regular personhood or public knowledge any of this information to me whatsoever. i've attempted suicide and even shot myself in the head, the bullet went out the back of my head and i survived.
the rest, i will share direct links there are a lot of content that was made that of artists i've had contact with, others and more i dont know about. i will periodically add links here.
but thats the least of the extreme harm or regret i've suffered and endured in life, i've spoken with and have had direct contact with jeffery epstein, a member of the trump family, nearby member or members of the clinton family sometime during the year 1992 or 1993 and by chance meeting with robert f kennedy junior at an outdoor restarunt while starving loooking for food, briefly meeting donald j trump in new york or new jersey from those years i was homeless and missing. i do not invent or manufacture or delude deception or misinformation whatsoever, its factual real and true information of the history of my time alive.
first and foremost, yoe mase and the song underwater by direct
